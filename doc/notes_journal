notes and journal for project

Sept 10,2013
starting project template format
this project is to analyse RT_PCR data using Anova, in R.
The input is an xls file that has the conditions and the fold change compared tothe control.  THere is a lot of data, both ligands and various inhbitiors, and it is hard to identify patterns by eye.
I will use anova to find significant changes.

Generic Steps:
 Mod from Faraway 2002
1. Record all steps in journal
2. Set up Git locally and on GitHub. Record details of Github locally)
3.    data collection (export to 'diagnostics' folder)
	a. how are data collected (random sampling?)
	b. is there non-response?
	c. are there missing values?
	d. how are data coded? 
	e. how are qualitative variables represented? 
	f. Do I need to convert them to factors?
        e. What are units of measurement?
	f. Can i get rid of extraneous digits to save space?
4.     Initial data Analysis (export to 'diagnostics' folder)
 	a. Print out summaries of data
		look for coding errors (NA converted to 0s)

	b. Make box plots and examine variance
	c. Make scatter plots for correlation analysis 
3. 
	
 	check for missing values 
	use boxplot or summaries (See Farraway PRA pdf)
4. recode for all factors
5. perform anova
6. output to single file for different primers
done

have new dataset from Becky, is HMEC and MDA231 cells with all PCR results for the project in .xls table.
this is put in data folder
